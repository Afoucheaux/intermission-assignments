# Module 2 Prep Work


## JavaScript

We'll be introducing some new JavaScript syntax this module which we'd like you to familiarize yourself with. Read the following chapters of [Understanding ECMAScript 6](https://leanpub.com/understandinges6/read):

- [Functions](https://leanpub.com/understandinges6/read#leanpub-auto-functions)
- [Expanded Object Functionality](https://leanpub.com/understandinges6/read#leanpub-auto-expanded-object-functionality)
- [Destructuring for Easier Data Access](https://leanpub.com/understandinges6/read#leanpub-auto-destructuring-for-easier-data-access)
- [Improved Array Capabilities](https://leanpub.com/understandinges6/read#leanpub-auto-improved-array-capabilities) (You're only expected to read the sections on "Creating Arrays" and "New Methods on All Arrays")

Then go through this [ES6 Tutorial](http://ccoenraets.github.io/es6-tutorial/):
  - `Setting Up Babel`
  - `Using let Variables`
  - `Using Destructuring`
  - `Using Arrow Functions`

Set up a repl.it account by folowing the directions [here](https://gist.github.com/thatPamIAm/ec20e805e385cc2b423185ef26bed046) 

And do the codecademy [ES6 Class Tutorial](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-javascript-classes/lessons/classes/exercises/introduction)


## Linting


## Debugging

While you may have seen and used the browser's Developer Tools in module 1, we'd like you to step through this Udemy course on [Dev Tools](https://www.udemy.com/devtools-2017-the-basics-of-chrome-developer-tools/). Some of it may be review, but you may pick up some new tricks along the way!


## Programming Paradigms

There are several different strategies you can take when architecting your JavaScript code (called "paradigms"). In mod 2, we'll be focusing on a pattern called "Object-Oriented Programming". Other paradigms you'll hear about are "Functional Programming" and "Procedural Programming". Read the following overviews on these paradigms:


Don't worry if the intricacies of these paradigms are still confusing, but try to walk away with



## Coding: Refactor Idea Box
  - rewrite long, nested if/else statements into switch statements (read further here)
  - DRY up your code (find areas where code is duplicated )
  - change for loops into `forEach`
  - try out converting some ES5 syntax to ES6!
