# Learn HTML and CSS Basics

Unless you have **significant** experience with HTML and CSS, choose one of these to complete:

1) [Shay Howe's Learn to Code HTML & CSS](http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/). Written tutorial. Super informative and comprehensive. Not obnoxious. Lots of hours.

2) [Khanacademy's HTML/CSS: Making Webpages](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-css). Video and in-browser editor. Super informative, slightly obnoxious at points :) Approximately 3-6 hours.

3) [Code Academy's HTML/CSS Course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/web). Interactive written tutorial. Fairly comprehensive. Approximately 5-7 hours.
