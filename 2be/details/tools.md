# Get Module 2 Tools

## Install Rails

If you don't already have it: 
```bash
gem install rails --version 5.1.6
```

Be careful not to install Rails 5.2 by only doing `gem install rails` -- our curriculum is not up to date with 5.2 changes, and you will need to uninstall 5.2.


## Download PostgreSQL

Download PostgreSQL from https://postgresapp.com/

Follow the instructions on their site to install the application and run the database.


## Install Chrome

If you are currently using another browser, download and install Chrome [here](https://www.google.com/chrome/). This will make it so that we can share shortcuts and have a consistent experience when debugging together as a class.
