# Module 2 Prep Work

1. [Get Module 2 Tools](details/tools.md): You're going to need these.
1. [Complete Rack Tutorial](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/rack_server): The bridge between M1 and M2 (complete through `4. Deploying`, come back to `Next Steps`/`Extensions` at the end of intermission if you have additional time).
1. [Complete a Static HTML/CSS Challenge](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/static_challenges): Additional practice with HTML/CSS. Timebox this to one or two hours. Styling can always be better, so know when to walk away.
1. [Jumpstart Lab SQL Tutorial](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/topics/sql/fundamental_sql.html): No one ever said, "gee, I wish I knew less SQL." **Do not complete the Sequel tutorial linked at the bottom of the Jumpstart Lab page.**
1. [Complete Task Manager](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/task_manager_redux): Complete so that we can review together during week 1 of the module.
