## HTML/CSS

### Task #1: Learn HTML and CSS Basics

  Unless you have **significant** experience with HTML and CSS, choose one of these to complete:

  1) [Shay Howe's Learn to Code HTML & CSS](http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/). Written tutorial. Super informative and comprehensive. Not obnoxious. Lots of hours.

  2) [Khanacademy's HTML/CSS: Making Webpages](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-css). Video and in-browser editor. Super informative, slightly obnoxious at points :) Approximately 3-6 hours.

  3) [Code Academy's HTML/CSS Course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/web). Interactive written tutorial. Fairly comprehensive. Approximately 5-7 hours.

### Task #2: Build a Personal Blog

  Use the HTML and CSS skills you learned to build yourself a personal blog site.

  Build a personal site with a blog portion using plain HTML and CSS. At minimum, your site should contain an `index.html`, `styles.css`, and a first blog post about your Mod 1 experience and your favorite technical concept: `insert-first-post-title-here.html`. Push your project to Github Pages using [these instructions as for one using Jekyll](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/electives/jekyll-blog-github-pages/pushing-project-to-gh-pages.markdown) (even though you're not using Jekyll).

### Task #3: Experiment with Bootstrap

  Complete this [Bootstrap tutorial](https://github.com/s-espinosa/bootstrap_tutorial).


### Task #4: Submit Your HTML/CSS Work

  Add links to your personal webpage, personal webpage repository, and your Bootstrap repositories [here](https://github.com/turingschool/ruby-submissions/blob/master/1611-b/2module/intermission_work/personal_site_html_css.md) by **Saturday, January 21**.

## SQL & Sinatra

### Task #1: [Web Guesser](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/web_guesser.html)

  Build out base functionality and add at least one of the extensions. Approximately 1-3 hours. Add a link to your repository [here](https://github.com/turingschool/ruby-submissions/blob/master/1611-b/2module/intermission_work/web_guesser.md) by **Thursday, January 19**.

### Task #2: [Jumpstart Lab SQL Tutorial](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/topics/sql/fundamental_sql.html)

  Complete the Jumstart Lab SQL Tutorial. **Do not complete the Sequel tutorial linked at the bottom of the Jumpstart Lab page.**

### Task #3: [Task Manager](https://github.com/s-espinosa/task_manager_redux)

  The entire tutorial will take approximately 1-3 hours. Build it once using the tutorial (*TYPE the code snippets -- do not copy!*), then try building it again with less reference to the tutorial. Add a link to your task manager repository [here](https://github.com/turingschool/ruby-submissions/blob/master/1611-b/2module/intermission_work/task_manager.md) by **Monday, January 23rd. __You will need to have this project finished before you can attend any class in module 2__.**

## Get Module 2 Tools

### Task #1: Install Rails

  If you don't already have it: `gem install rails`.

### Task #2: Download Postgres

  Download the [Postgres app](http://postgresapp.com/).

  __OR: Use Homebrew to install Postgres:__

  From your terminal, run:

  ```
  brew update
  brew install postgres
  ln -sfv /usr/local/opt/postgresql/*.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents
  launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.postgresql.plist
  ```
  [want to know a little more?](http://www.fyquah.me/setup-postgresql-on-os-x)

  These last 2 lines will set up a special Daemon init file so that your operating
  system will start postgres automatically whenever you log in.
