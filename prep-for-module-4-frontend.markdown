# Module 4 Intermission Assignments

## Filling Out Your Skill Set

1. To refamiliarize yourself with the HTTP request-response cycle, [watch this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eesqK59rhGA).
1. Read Eloquent JavaScript: [Chapter 17 - HTTP](http://eloquentjavascript.net/17_http.html) and [Chapter 20 - Node.js](http://eloquentjavascript.net/20_node.html). The exercises at the end of the chapters are great practice (your answers to these exercises will not be collected).
1. Complete this [lesson on writing a Node HTTP server](http://frontend.turing.io/lessons/module-4/node-prework.html) - **Deliverable:** Walk through the lesson and code along; finish the functions `getAllMessages` and `addMessage` at the end of the lesson.
1. Complete the [tutorial for writing an Express server](https://medium.com/@jaeger.rob/introduction-to-nodes-express-js-db5617047150) - **Deliverable:** In addition to going through the tutorial, work on 3 out of 4 of the problems in the "Further Challenges" section at the end of the tutorial.
1. Watch [this video on RESTful APIs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLwpqD8n3d0), and then read these things [about RESTful API design](https://hackernoon.com/restful-api-designing-guidelines-the-best-practices-60e1d954e7c9). You'll be building your own RESTful APIs from scratch this module.
1. Read about and practice writing [Promises](https://gist.github.com/robbiejaeger/dc8f55c1f9462741090862f736b82cab) - **Deliverable:** Write your own promises in the "Promise Approach: On Your Own" section
1. Refresh your familiarity with the git rebase workflow (you might need to use this on projects in module 4). Read this article on [git rebase](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/rewriting-history/git-rebase) and this article on [merging vs. rebasing](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/merging-vs-rebasing). Your open source project this module might require you to use a rebase workflow instead of merge.

*Note:* For the first project in module 4, you will have to use jQuery again (you will not be able to use React or other frameworks in the first project, for instance). _Refresh your skills as needed._

## Prework Submission

You are expected to have the prework completed by day one of module 4. For the items marked as **Deliverable**, you will submit links to your finished work to a homework submission file. [This is the homework submission file](https://github.com/turingschool/front-end-submissions-public/blob/master/1803/mod-4/homework-submissions.md).

To submit your prework assignments, make a pull request to add links to your finished work under your name. We will use this submission file for the rest of your homework throughout the module as well.
