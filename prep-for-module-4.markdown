# Module 4 Intermission Assignments

During Module 4 we'll be focusing on a few topics:

* Expanding your existing Javascript knowledge to build more sophisticated UI-driven applications
* Expanding your Ruby and Rails knowledge to build web applications using more sophisticated
  architectural patterns
* Exploring new tools in both the Javascript and Ruby ecosystems that help us achieve these goals

The assignments below are intended to help give us some context for working through these topics, so as
you read/work through them, consider how they conform to or conflict with what you've seen so far about Ruby and Javascript.

### Submitting your Work

Each of the assignments has (or will have) a Github issue associated with it [here][ghissues]. The reading/watching assignments don't have "deliverables" per-se, but as you go through them please take notes and report your thoughts back to the associated github issue. We'll also have large and small group discussions on the monday you return.
