# Module 4 Intermission Assignments

During Module 4 we'll be focusing on a few topics:

* Expanding your existing Javascript knowledge to build more sophisticated UI-driven applications
* Expanding your Ruby and Rails knowledge to build web applications using more sophisticated
  architectural patterns
* Exploring new tools in both the Javascript and Ruby ecosystems that help us achieve these goals

The assignments below are intended to help give us some context for working through these topics, so as
you read/work through them, consider how they conform to or conflict with what you've seen so far about Ruby and Javascript.

### Submitting your Work

Each of the assignments has (or will have) a Github issue associated with it [here][ghissues]. 

The reading/watching assignments don't have "deliverables" per-se, but as you go through them please take notes and report your thoughts back to the associated github issue. 

**Non-optional assignments will be due for points** We'll also have large and small group discussions on the monday you return.

## Code (

### NoteSchool.io (10 points)

This week, you'll be working through some workshopper courses at [nodeschool.io][ns].

[ns]: http://nodeschool.io

Please work through _at least two_ of the following courses:

* [javascripting](https://github.com/sethvincent/javascripting)
* [lololodash](https://github.com/mdunisch/lololodash)
* [ExpressWorks](https://github.com/azat-co/expressworks)

### jQuery Fundamentals (10 points)

You'll also be working through Bocoup's [jQuery Fundamentals](http://jqfundamentals.com).

### Exercisms (10 points)

Complete [exercism.io][exer] exercises in JavaScript, writing a gist of what you saw when comparing the answer to five other answers that other folks got
If you have trouble with the exercism UI, you can find other versions of exercisms you submitted at this link:http://exercism.io/tracks/javascript/exercises
[Here is an example of what we expect.](https://gist.github.com/tgraham777/9f284f096ba9da89a159)

## Study

* **Read**: [Sandi Metz' Rules For Developers][sandi] (10 minutes) (5 points)
  * Which of Sandi's rules do you feel like might be the hardest to follow—why?
* **Read**: [Speaking JavaScript](http://speakingjs.com/es5/) (5 points)
  * please read the following chapters: 
    * [Chapter 3: The Nature of JavaScript](http://speakingjs.com/es5/ch03.html)
    * [Chapter 15: Functions](http://speakingjs.com/es5/ch15.html)
    * [Chapter 16: Variables: Scopes, Environments, and Closures](http://speakingjs.com/es5/ch16.html)
    * [Chapter 17: Objects and Inheritance](http://speakingjs.com/es5/ch17.html)


### Optional

* **Read**: [Using Arel to Compose SQL Queries][arel] by Sean Griffin
* **Read**: [JavaScript Garden](http://bonsaiden.github.io/JavaScript-Garden/)
* **Listen**: [Shop Talk: Tom Dale](http://shoptalkshow.com/episodes/147-tom-dale/) (1.5 hours)
  * Do you agree with Tom? What parts of his argument are compelling? What parts do you disagree with?

As we move into the final module of Turing, we're getting fairly competent at producing useful software. But rather than being the end of the journey, this really just opens the door to even deeper rabbit holes—now that I can get something done, what other ways might there be to accomplish the same thing? The same observable effects could be accomplished via numerous different combinations of code. What are the underlying opinions and ideas embodied by each choice?

Here are are a few more "philosophical" materials to hopefully help us contemplate this side of the issue:

* [Execution in the Kingdom of Nouns by Steve Yegge](http://steve-yegge.blogspot.ca/2006/03/execution-in-kingdom-of-nouns.html) - You've been doing object-oriented programming for almost 6 months now. What are some of the limitations imposed by this approach? How do Ruby and/or Javascript capture the benefits of OO while avoiding some of the pitfalls?
* [Simplicity Matters by Rich Hickey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rI8tNMsozo0) - As we move into working on larger and more sophisticated systems, some of the approaches that have worked on smaller projects may no longer be so effective. What does Rich Hickey say about the common pitfalls of Ruby and Rails applications?
* [The Birth and Death of Javascript by Gary Bernhardt](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/the-birth-and-death-of-javascript) - This talk takes a tongue-in-cheek tone, but the concepts discussed are very topical. What does Bernhardt suggest about the role of Javascript in shaping the modern web?
* [Real Software Engineering by Glenn Vanderburg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP9AIUT9nos) - What does Glenn have to say about Software Engineering as a discipline? How does Software Engineering differ fundamentally from other Engineering disciplines? What can we as Software Engineers take away from other disciplines?
