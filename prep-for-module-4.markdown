# Module 4 Intermission Assignments

Each of the assignments has (or will have) a Github issue associated with it [here][ghissues].

You're expected to contribute in each of the issue discussion threads. We'll also have large and small group discussions on the monday you return.

[ghissues]: https://github.com/turingschool/intermission-assignments/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A1410

## Build

You'll be building a modified version of [Jet Fuel](https://gist.github.com/stevekinney/cac8d9374e99a0d7d4b2).

You should have a link to your repository posted [here][jfsub]. The project itself doesn't need to be done until the first day of the module.
