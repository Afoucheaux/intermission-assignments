* [A Guide to Testing Ruby on Rails Applications](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/testing.html): Testing is quite important in our community. Learn the preferred way of testing your Rails apps according to the Rails core team.
* [How We Test Rails Applications](http://robots.thoughtbot.com/how-we-test-rails-applications): In every community, there are various opinions on how to do the same thing. Learn how Thoughtbot likes to test their applications in this brief guide.
