# Assignments to Prep for Module 3

## Ruby on Rails

### Required

#### Do

Rewrite your Little Shop `routes.rb`:

Module 3 requires you to know URLs, paths and HTTP verbs inside and out. Rewrite the routes file for your Little Shop to use only methods that map directly to HTTP verbs: `get`, `post`, `put`, `patch` and `delete`. You will probably need to add `to:` and `as:` parameters to make sure your apps continue to work, and tests continue to pass.

If you do not own the repo for your project, fork it, and rewrite the routes file individually.
