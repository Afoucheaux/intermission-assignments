This week, you'll be working through some courses at [nodeschool.io][ns]. The point of these courses is to get back into exploring resources to write JavaScript differently, now that you have 2 full modules under your belt.

[ns]: http://nodeschool.io

Please work through _at least 2_ of the following courses (ideally those you aren't familiar with):

* [Promise It Won't Hurt](https://github.com/stevekane/promise-it-wont-hurt)
* [Lololodash](https://github.com/mdunisch/lololodash)
* [Scope Chains and Closures](https://github.com/jesstelford/scope-chains-closures)
* [ExpressWorks](https://github.com/azat-co/expressworks)

### Optional

Here are some podcasts and videos to listen to and watch respectively:

- [Learning JavaScript in 2016 - JS Jabber](https://devchat.tv/js-jabber/219-jsj-learning-javascript-in-2016)
- [Shop Talk with Tom Dale](http://shoptalkshow.com/episodes/147-tom-dale/) (This one is a bit older but still a good introduction for thinking about why client-side applications are important and what frameworks bring to the table.)
