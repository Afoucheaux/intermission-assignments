# PD Pre-Work for Mod 3
## Objective: Create an Interview Prep System

### Directions
1. Start an interview prep notes doc. This is where you'll jot down notes on specific examples you'll draw from in answers,  types of code problems you should study, and any other interview prep resources you need to keep track of. This could be a google doc, gist, or your journal, but you need to have a specific place where you keep track of interview prep information. 

2. Bookmark [this Interview Prep Resources markdown](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_four/interview_prep_resources.md) and read through it. Pick at least 2 resources to read more in-depth and use this research to add to your interview prep doc from step #1. 

3. In your interview prep notes, come up with at least 5 questions that you could ask your interviewer. You will use these questions in your mock interview with Kayt or Allison in Mod 3. [This list](https://github.com/yangshun/tech-interview-handbook/blob/master/non-technical/questions-to-ask.md) can help you get started.

You may be asked to show or discuss your interview prep process with Allison, Kayt, or your instructors. 

### Other Recommended Next Steps (Not Required)
* Reach out to one of the mentors listed in the Interview Prep Resources markdown to set up a mock technical interview 
* Complete a mock interview on Pramp
* Set up whiteboarding practice to go through specific code problems listed in the markdown


## Extra
[*optional*]

Here are some podcasts and videos to listen to and watch respectively:

- [Testing with Fun Fun Function](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0zVEGEvSaeF_zoW9o66wa_UCNE3a7BEr) (This is a playlist of 7 YouTube videos on testing)
- [Shop Talk with Tom Dale](http://shoptalkshow.com/episodes/147-tom-dale/) (This one is a bit older but still a good introduction for thinking about why client-side applications are important and what frameworks bring to the table.)
- [Wes Bos JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com) (Maybe pick 5 or 10 exercises - try to challenge yourself)
